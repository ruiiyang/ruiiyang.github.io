		<h3>Goby Fish in Norweigian Fjord</h3>

		<p>This was a project during my master degree back in April 2019 in Bergen, Norway which is also my first living in Norway. Here are some biology/evcology backgroun knowledge:
			<br>
			<br>
		1.When there is a food web structure to follow, even the accident affecting the krill could cause whales to be hungry for months. 
		2. two-spotted goby Pomatoschistus flavescens has sexual selection.  it is common for a male goby to have a number of female partners and for the females to lay their eggs collectively in a nest that the male then guards. 
		But for one goby to have so many partners while other gobies have none.
		Their seasonal population gender rate changes is vast.
		3.Yet, this trend is slowly disappearing because of the Norweigian water is getting warmer. That affects their gender transformation speed. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Therefore, the current gender ratio is the key issue. That relates to reproduction then the population size in the future.
